## Input:

Create a new language like English. Use a method like Korean that changing verbe tense adding something in the end.

## Output:

Sure, let's call our new language "Klingon" (inspired by the language from the Star Trek universe). In Klingon, verb tense is indicated by adding a suffix to the end of the verb. For example, the suffix "-pa" could indicate the past tense, while the suffix "-va" could indicate the future tense.

Here are some examples of how this would work in practice:

- "I eat" = "jIH jIj" (present tense)
- "I ate" = "jIH jIj-pa" (past tense)
- "I will eat" = "jIH jIj-va" (future tense)
Note that the verb comes at the end of the sentence in Klingon, just like in Korean. This is because the subject and object of the sentence are indicated by the word order and verb suffixes, so the verb itself doesn't need to change form depending on who or what it is referring to.

Of course, this is just a very basic example of how verb tense could be indicated in Klingon. There could be many different suffixes for different verb tenses and aspects, just like there are in English and other languages. The important thing is that the verb tense is indicated by adding a suffix to the end of the verb, rather than by changing the form of the verb itself.


## Input:

What does jiH mean in Klingon?

## Output:

In the example given above, "jIH" is the subject of the sentence (meaning "I" or "me"). It is not a verb, so it doesn't have a specific meaning on its own. In Klingon, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, so "jIj" is the verb in that sentence, meaning "to eat" or "eat".

## Input:

How can you say "They eat" in Klingon?

## Output:

To say "they eat" in Klingon, we would need to know the subject pronoun for "they" in Klingon. Since Klingon is a fictional language, there is no established way to say this. However, if we assume that the subject pronoun for "they" in Klingon is similar to the subject pronoun for "they" in English (i.e. "they"), we could say "they eat" in Klingon as follows:

"They eat" = "they jIj" (present tense)
Again, note that the verb comes at the end of the sentence in Klingon. The subject pronoun "they" comes before the verb, indicating who or what the verb is referring to. If we wanted to indicate the past or future tense, we would add a suffix to the end of the verb, just like in the examples given earlier. For example:

"They ate" = "they jIj-pa" (past tense)
"They will eat" = "they jIj-va" (future tense)
These are just examples, of course. The exact form of the Klingon language would depend on how it is constructed. This is just a basic idea of how verb tense could be indicated in Klingon using a method similar to Korean.
